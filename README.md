# Deep-Learning-Fonts-Classification
- Description: Collected and annotated dataset, built the model (based on LeNet, AlexNet) which is able to recognize fonts in images. The model was built on 3 datasets:
  + for all Latin alphabet
  + for every character (we experiment in 5 alphabets A, B, C, D, E )
  + the combined data from 5 alphabets in dataset 2
with 95% and 92% accuracy (best score in AlexNet, LeNet)
- Techstack: Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, OpenCV
